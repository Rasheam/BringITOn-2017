  <h2> The reason as to why this project came around was due to the compettition BringITOn.</h2>
  <p> In 2017 we were tasked with creating a webpage that would help better our communities. From this project I had chosen North 24th Street, as it has had significant historical significance to our town and also due to the fact that in a previous year another team from north had made a project based on the area. What led to this trying to attract employers to the area is due to the fact that in the same year I had also heard of a person who wanted to open up a new store in this area and it gave me hope that maybe one day it would be returned to what it used to be.
